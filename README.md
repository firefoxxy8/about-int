# How can a developer help The New York Times newsroom?

The Interactive News team at The New York Times is looking for creative, interdisciplinary thinkers with strong technical backgrounds.

## Who We Are
We are a digital projects team embedded within The New York Times newsroom. We build tools for reporters, editors, and designers and special projects for our readers.  We work on behind-the-scenes technology, collaborating with teams that handle data, graphics, and unique design presentations.

## What We Do
- Experiment with new reporting and story forms to expand the horizons of our news report
- Guide, train and support the use of our tools

## What We Build
- The [data pipeline] that drives The New York Times [election results]
- A [software deployment] environment that hosts 130+ applications
- A [messaging experience] for readers to follow our reporters in the field
- Tools to collect reader submissions to drive [stories dependent on reader voices]
- The [API] that powers our Olympic results and graphics
- A [Django app] for accessing Supreme Court data
- And much more
